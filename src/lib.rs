//! A crate with helper functions that execute given closures in parallel on all available processors.
#![doc(html_root_url = "https://docs.rs/mth_calc/0.1.0")]

use std::thread;

/// Runs a given closure in parallel on all available CPUs.
/// 
/// The given closure can return a value. All return values of all closure executions are 
/// aggregated with a given aggregation closure. The method returns a tuple with
/// the aggregated result and the number of executions (=number of CPUs).
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// 
/// * `body` - closure that should be run in parallel on all available processors.
/// * `initial` - initial value used for aggregating the results of all closure executions.
/// * `agg` - closure used to aggregate method results.
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// use mth_calc::run_on_all_cpus;
/// use rand::prelude::*;
/// 
/// let result = mth_calc::run_on_all_cpus::<f32>(|| {
///     // Create a thread-local random generator
///     let mut rng = thread_rng();
///
///     // Calculate sum over ten random numbers
///     let mut total = 0f32;
///     for _ in 0..10 {
///         total += rng.gen::<f32>();
///     }
///
///     total
/// }, 
/// 0f32, // initial value for aggreation is zero
/// |x, y| { x + y }); // aggregation function = sum
/// 
/// let avg = result.0 / (result.1 * 10) as f32;
/// # if avg < 0f32 || avg >= 1f32 {
/// #   panic!();
/// # }
/// println!("The average random number was {}", avg);
